I am a Research Associate (Pre-Doctoral) at the Indian School of Business (ISB), working with Prof. Deepa Mani on projects at the intersection of technology and work. I build large-scale data infrastructures and analytic tools to understand how AI and digital platforms are reshaping jobs, skills, and how organisations learn.

My work combines LLMs, embedding methods, and knowledge graphs to model how skill bundles form and change over time. I developed an AI-ML pipeline to create a high-frequency labour market database for India, extracting and standardizing job postings to enable granular labour market analytics. I also constructed a skill ontology and knowledge network by integrating structured LLM-based extraction with Neo4j graph databases.

More broadly, I am interested in human-AI interaction and information systems, aiming to ground this work in empirical evidence that informs organisations and policy makers to adapt to technological changes.
